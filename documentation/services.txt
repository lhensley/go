Simple Example & Overview: https://medium.com/@benmorel/creating-a-linux-service-with-systemd-611b5c8b91d6
	.service files go in /etc/systemd/system directory (or /lib/systemd/system ?)

Lane Services ("unit files")
	Developed and stored in $GIT_GO_SERVICES
	upd script copies them to $SERVICES_DIR ("/lib/systemd/system")


Pull up any unit file from the $GIT_GO_SERVICES directory. They're easy to adapt. Things you'll need to specify:
	Description
	Executable
	User/Group Running the Executable

	Start and test
		sudo systemctl start SERVICE_NAME
		sudo systemctl status SERVICE_NAME

	Enable (have it automatically start on bootup) (Creates a symlink to the .service file in /etc/systemd/system/multi-user.target.wants)
		sudo systemctl enable SERVICE_NAME
