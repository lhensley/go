# To Do
* Faster way to back up Plex configs
* Figure out why oz won't resolve nuc01 without FQDN
* Pick up missed m4v files from work and move to store
* Backup tiers: Incrementals to external drive, then zip the contents weekly?
* Update backup script for oz and nuc01
* Backup ~/.ssh and /root/.ssh
* Amend config lookup so it checks the variable and not the file
